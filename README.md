# Daylio-mood-analysis
This are the entires from my personal mood tracker Daylio (without activity, cause it's a bit personal). BTW, highly recommended. 

Usually with Daylio you log not only mood, but what you are doing at that moment. I've deleted that section because it's too personal but also because the app does a pretty good job with analysing their influence on mood.

Myt idea is to use it later later for a project connecting mood and sleep. 

Stay tuned
